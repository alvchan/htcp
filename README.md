# htcp - HTML Template Copy-Paste (engine)

It's as the title suggests: a silly experiment and foray into Perl via the
creation of a dumb tool I actually needed. 

The goal of this script is to create a way to reuse html from elsewhere (e.g.
navbars, headers, footers) without manually copy-pasting. Ideally, I don't
manually copy-paste as a mean of reducing the amount of differences and errors
that are incurred in the long-term.
